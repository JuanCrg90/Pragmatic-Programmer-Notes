<h1> A Pragmatic Philosophy </h1>
</a>

## The cat ate my source code
- Take responsibility from your code.
- Don't blame provide Solutions not excuses.
- Provide options dont make lame excuses.

 
## Software Entropy
- Don't live with broken windows.

 
## Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
- Be a catalyst for change
- The difference between the broken windows and the boiled frog is: people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive that no one else cares. The frog just doesn't notice the change.

## Good Enough Software
- Make quality a requirements issue.
- Know when to stop. Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement.

## Your knowledge portfolio
- It's similar to a financial portfolio, you should to invest regularly, diversify, manage the risk, buy low sell high (early adopter) review and rebalance.

Goals
- Learn at least one. New language every year.
- Read a technical book each quarter.
- Read non technical books too.
- Take classes.
- Participate in local user groups.
- Experiment with different environments.
- Stay current.
- Get wired.

Critical thinking
- Analyze what you read and hear. You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.


## Communicate
- Know what you want to say.
- Know your audience (Wisdom).
  - **W**hat do you want them to learn?
  - What is ther **i**nterest in what you've got to say?
  - How **s**ophisticated are they?
  - How much **d**etail do they want?
  - Whom do you want to **o**wn the information?
  - How can you **m**otivate them to listen to you?
- Choose your moment (is this a good time to talk about ...).
- Choose a style.
- Make it look good.
- Involve your audience.
- Be a listener.
- Get back to people (It's Both What You Say and the Way That You Say It).

<h1> A Pragmatic Approach </h1>
</a>

## The evils of duplication
- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself

## How does duplication arise?
- Imposed duplication.
- Inadverted duplication.
- Impatiend duplication.
- Interdeveloper duplication.

## Orthogonality
- In computing, the term  has come to signifify a kind of independence or decoupling.
- The helicopter controls are not orthogonal.
- The orthogonality elimiate effects between unrelated things.

## Reversibility
- There are not final decisions.

## Tracer Bullets
- Use tracer bullets to find the target.

## Prototypes ans Post-it Notes
- Prototype to learn.

## Domain Languages
- Program close to the problem domain.

## Estimating
- Estimate to avoid surprises.
- Iterate the schedule with the code.

<h1> The Basic Tools </h1>
</a>

> Tools amplify your talent, The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive you can be.

## The Power of Plain Text

- Keep Knowledge in Plain Text.

## Shell Games

- Use the power of Command Shells

As a pragmatic programmer, you will constantly want to perform ad hoc operarions-things that the GUI may not support. The command line is better suited when you want to quickly conbine a couple of commands to perform a query oos some other task. 

## Power Editing
- Use a Single Editor Well (vim FTW)
> The editor will be an extension of your hand.
